# Nelder-Mead method in Java

This is an implementation of the [Nelder-Mead method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method) in (native) Java.

The Nelder–Mead method (also downhill simplex method, amoeba method, or polytope method) is a numerical method used to find the minimum or maximum of an objective function in a multidimensional space.

The implementation contains (for now):

1. The core logic of the method
2. A visualization module
